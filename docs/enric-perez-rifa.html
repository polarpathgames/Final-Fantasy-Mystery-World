        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <br>
        As responsible of the UI I have designed almost the different features and programmed some of them. Of course, 
        I could not have designed neither programmed what I have done without the help of the different roles such as art, design and code.
        </br>
    <h3>Screens</h3>
    <br>
    First of all, as a UI designer I designed the following screens.
    </br>
<h4>Main Menu</h4>
<br>
In this screen I took the background image from Final Fantasy Tactics and put the buttons without background in order to make the interface clearer
so the player will not be overwhelmed with too much images.
</br>
<br>

</br>
   <h4>Options Menu</h4>
<br>
This menu took different changes along the development so we finally got this version due to the usefulness of the different buttons,
such as the volume up and the buttons, that previously were sliders.
</br>
<br>

</br>
<h4>End Game Screen</h4>
<br>
This screen is used as a credits screen so as soon as the player completes the game, the screen will appear and show all the members of the team
and the roles they took part.
</br>
<br>

</br>
<h4>Select Character Menu<h4>
    <br>
    Specifically, in this menu I took part both as a designer and as a programmer. I made the buttons design, such has idle, hover and click animations.
    I took the characters' images and photoshoped them in order to fit in the screen. In addition, the characters' information about their health points,
    mana points and attack, so the player gets useful information about which character fits better with his playing style.
