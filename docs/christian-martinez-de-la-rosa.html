    <h2>My work</h2>
    As a team lead, my work was to guide the team to the right direction and to keep the team together.
    Also, inside the project, I have mainly worked in code, specifically in data structure and data management.
    </br>
    In general, I have had meetings with the <a href="lluis-moreu-farran.html">manager</a> in order to create the team meeting points, 
    to know the deviation of the team and prevent possible risks.
    </br>
    </br>
    As I said, I focused in code, now I will explain some features I have implemented.
    <h3>UI System</h3>
    I have implemented the base of the UI System. The system works with a list of UI elements and has implemented a BFS algorithm to go through it. To get the input, 
    the game travel for the UI list from the childs to the parent, to paint the UI, it travels inversely. The system includes the base UI elements:
    <h4>Image</h4>
    Image UI is the simplest element. Is a section of the atlas UI texture and, also, can be a sequence of frames, creating an animation.
    <h4>Button</h4>
    The Button UI has integrated the three main states: idle, on hover and click. Moreover, has a system of listeners to set logic when button is pushed. In addition, I
    have created the logic of focus to move between buttons.
    <h4>Label</h4>
    The Label element is a little more complex. First, has basic parameters like text, color and font, and automatically the program calculates the size it occupies on the screen. 
    In addition, it has a warp parameter that will cut the phrases to fit in the warp zone. Also, it has the posibility to set a background. You can choose a color and a
    alpha value and the program will paint the background behind the label, it is usefull in cases that you need readability.
    <h3>Font System</h3>
    In relation with the UI System, I have created a system to load fonts. We had the problem that for every label we created, a font was opened, so if we created 10 labels with the 
    same font and size, the program will open 10 equal fonts. In order to solve that, I have created a system that only open a font if there is not any equal opened before. To make
    it more readability, I had set a few fonts with default sizes we will use in a xml file. Every time that a label is created, it will find if there is a font with that
    characteristics and if it exist, will return that font pointer. Font can be searched by name(string) or by id(enum) we have declared.
